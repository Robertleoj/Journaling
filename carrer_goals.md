# Career goals

This document is for me to think about my career goals.

# Big picture
## What do I want to do?
What do I want to do? What is the plan?

It seems like recently there have been two general paths on my mind. The first is AI engineer, and the second is an AI researcher. 

In fact, both of these sound amazing, and I think at least for now, the path to achieving these two is the same. So I do not really need to pick between these. 

Now, why do I want this? 

### Why?

I think AI is immensely exciting, fascinating, and larger than life. The thought of creating and *understanding* something intelligent really captures me. 

Also, I can't really imagine myself doing anything else. Ok I might. But I feel I would grow tired of it, and that image does not appear in my mind when it comes to AI. 

Also, AI will bring about the largest event in all of human history. If that is not exciting enough, I don't know what is. 

It might not be beneficial for humanity. It might be completely disasterous. Today, it seems like we have many examples of both, and everything in between. 

OpenAI's goal of making sure that the AI that is brought into our world will be beneficial is one that I agree with. Whatever happens, I want to be a part of it, and do my best to help create the best outcome we can get. 

Also, I've heard that it pays a huge bunch. Fuck yeah. 

AI also seems to play to my strengths. It seems like I am faster to pick up math and programming than most other things. And I really like programming and doing math. 

Being an AI engineer/researcher really seems like the perfect goal. 

# How?
This is the question; the big one, the chunky one, the hard one.

I've been trying to figure this out since I got on this path. 

However, it really seems like I have never sat down and written a plan. Or taken a serious sit down and created a plan. I've always just thought "If I just get good enough at it, then it will surely happen!". And then I would proceed to start studying random things in AI, without much correlation to my skill level. 

So let's sit down and think about it. 

I will first describe my current approach, and critisize it to pieces. 
Next, I will try to formulate a real, actionable plan for achieving my goals. 

## My current approach



## Formulating a plan
There are pretty much two interlinked questions.
